This is R.O.S.S. The Request-oriented-speaker-system. This is a program that allows you and your friends to listen to music, without the need to fight over one device to play the songs you want to hear.

### Things it actually does:
  - Takes requests from a user.
  - Downloads the song in the background.
  - Uses a websocket to display a live up-next and now playing list.
  - Plays the song after it has been downloaded.
  - Has an admin panel to control volume and skip songs.
  - Has a basic login screen, and uses bootstrap for CSS.

### To Do:
  - Add a blacklist of banned songs.
  - Add a button to add a song in the queue to the blacklist.
  - Add a button to remove a song from the queue.
  - Add the option to add new credentials and change the default ones.
  - Add in a vote skip button.
  - Change format to a smaller file, that's still compatible with VLC player.
