This is R.O.S.S. The Request-oriented-speaker-system. This is a program that allows you and your friends to listen to music, without the need to fight over one device to play the songs you want to hear.

### Core features:
  - Takes requests from a user. (Youtube video)
  - Downloads the song in the background.
  - Uses a websocket to display a live up-next and now playing list.
  - Plays the song after it has been downloaded.
  - Has an admin panel for various tasks.
